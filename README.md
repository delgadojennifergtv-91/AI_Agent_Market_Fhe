# AI Agent Marketplace with FHE-encrypted Capabilities

The **AI Agent Marketplace** revolutionizes the way developers and consumers interact in the world of artificial intelligence by enabling the sale of FHE-encrypted AI agents as NFTs. Powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, this decentralized marketplace allows buyers to utilize sophisticated AI agents while maintaining the confidentiality of their underlying models and algorithms. 

## A Challenge Tackled

In today's digital landscape, AI technologies are essential for numerous applications, yet their implementation raises significant security and privacy concerns. Traditional models expose sensitive data, risking intellectual property theft and misuse. Developers face challenges in monetizing their AI agents without compromising their proprietary algorithms, while buyers hesitate to invest in AI solutions with uncertain security.

## The FHE Solution

This project directly addresses these concerns through the innovative use of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**. By employing Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, the AI Agent Marketplace allows developers to securely encrypt their AI models, safeguarding their intellectual property. This means that buyers can execute complex tasks using the AI agents without exposing the crucial data or algorithms, ensuring both privacy and security. 

With Zama's technology, buyers run agents on their encrypted data, generating insights without breaching confidentiality or ownership rights. This creates a thriving economy where innovation flourishes without fear of exploitation.

## Core Features

✨ **FHE Encryption**: Every AI agent is securely encrypted, preserving the confidentiality of its model and algorithms.

🖼️ **NFT Representation**: AI agents are offered as NFTs, allowing developers to trade their creations seamlessly and securely.

🔐 **Privacy Preservation**: Buyers can utilize AI agents on their encrypted datasets without risk of data exposure.

🤖 **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive marketplace platform where developers can showcase their AI agents and buyers can browse, test, and purchase.

🌐 **Decentralized Architecture**: Ensuring no central authority, the marketplace operates on a blockchain, enhancing trust and transparency.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK** (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Solidity** (for smart contract development)
- **Node.js** (for backend development)
- **Hardhat** (for Ethereum development framework)
- **IPFS** (for decentralized storage of NFTs)

## Installation Guide

If you have downloaded this project, follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Ensure you have Node.js installed** (version 14.x or higher recommended).
2. **Navigate to the project directory**.
3. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies, including the required Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Please do not use `git clone` or any repository URLs to obtain this project.

## Build & Run Guide

After setting up the project, compile, test, and run the AI Agent Marketplace with the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the marketplace to an Ethereum testnet**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

Replace `<network_name>` with your designated test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Kovan) to deploy the smart contract.

## Example Code

Here’s a brief example of how a developer might structure an AI agent in Solidity:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract AI_Agent_Market is ERC721 {
    struct AIAgent {
        string name;
        string encryptedModel;
        address owner;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => AIAgent) public agents;
    uint256 public agentCount;

    constructor() ERC721("AI Agent", "AIA") {}

    function createAgent(string memory _name, string memory _encryptedModel) public {
        agents[agentCount] = AIAgent(_name, _encryptedModel, msg.sender);
        _mint(msg.sender, agentCount);
        agentCount++;
    }
}
```

This snippet illustrates how to define an AI agent as an NFT, allowing developers to create new agents with an encrypted model stored on the blockchain.
